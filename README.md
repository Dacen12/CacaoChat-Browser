<h3>Please note:</h3>

:warning:
This project uses browserify for translating server side javascript to client side javascript, the code for this can be found inside ``browser.js``
This means that for both  `client.js`  and  `begin.js`  the code won't automatically update once you apply changes and restart your browser

 - - - -  


✅ If you would like to make changes to the client side javascript type `npm run watch` to automatically update the `client.js` file (Actual code for the chatroom)

✅ And `npm run watchHome` to automatically update changes when you apply new code to `begin.js` (Start screen of the application)

 <h3>✔️ Finally </h3>
 
 To run the application, simply type `npm run start` in the terminal to start the application.
